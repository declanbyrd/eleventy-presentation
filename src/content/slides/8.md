## What's next?

<section>

Ideally I'd like to add the following features:

- Speaker notes.
- Using 11ty data to create slide themes from JSON.
- Presentation progress indicator.
- Toggle video on/off with keyboard shortcut.
- Improved navigation for slides where keyboard input is required.
- Transitions and animations, 3D effects.
